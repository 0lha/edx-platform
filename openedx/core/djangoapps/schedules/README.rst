Dynamic Pacing Schedules
========================

The Schedules app allows course teams to automatically email learners in
self-paced courses. The emails are designed to keep learners engaged
with a course's content. Learners receive these messages at important
milestones throughout a course.

With Schedules, the author of a self-paced course opts learners into one
of two "Schedule Experiences". Learners either receive Weekly Course
Highlight Messages, or a combination of Recurring Nudges and Upgrade
Reminders.

The app can send all three message types "out of the box":

-  Recurring Nudges
-  Upgrade Reminders
-  Weekly Course Highlight Messages

Recurring Nudges encourage learners to engage with self-paced courses at
regular intervals. The app sends nudges three days and ten days after a
learner enrolls in a course.

Upgrade Reminders ask learners to purchase their course's "Verified"
certificate. The reminders are sent two days from their course's upgrade
deadline, or two days from the course's end date. Whichever date occurs
sooner.

Weekly Course Highlight Messages tell learners what to look forward to
in the coming week of a course. Course authors provide "section
highlights" when authoring a course in Studio. The app generates emails
with these section highlights listed in the body of the message.

The app introduces the Schedule object to the edX codebase. Learners
receive Schedules when they enroll in self-paced courses. With
Schedules, the app determines when to send particular messages. It
assumes a steady rate of progress through course materials. It
determines the cadence of its messaging through a course's "Schedule
Experience".

Glossary
--------

-  **Schedule**: Stores the day a learner enrolls in a course and the
   learner's "upgrade deadline".

-  **Schedule Experience**: Defines which set of emails that a learner
   will receive so that they have a consistent email experience
   throughout their time in the course even if a course author makes
   changes to the course after they enroll. Right now, the possible
   Schedule Experiences are:

   -  "Recurring Nudge and Upgrade Reminder"
   -  "Course Updates"

-  **Upgrade Deadline**: The date before which a learner can purchase a
   verified certificate. A Schedule imposes a "soft" upgrade deadline 21
   days from when a learner enrolled in a course. A self-paced course
   imposes a "hard" upgrade deadline that is the course-wide expiration
   date for upgrading on the course. A learner's Schedule will use
   whichever date is earlier.

-  **Course Update**: In the code, we refer to Weekly Course Highlight
   messages as Course Updates. In hindsight, this is confusing since we
   also use the term Course Updates to refer to bulk-emails manually
   sent out by course instructors. We haven't had the chance to rename
   these variables in the code yet.

-  **Highlights**: A list of topics that learners should expect to learn
   in a section of a course. These are defined by course authors in the
   Studio UI.

-  **Resolver**: Python class that defines which learners to filter to
   for the message type and then creates and sends an email to each of
   those learners.

-  **MessageType**: Python class that defines a particular kind of email
   message and the Django template it uses. `MessageType is an ACE
   concept <https://edx-ace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules.html#edx_ace.message.MessageType>`__.

-  **Task**: A
   `Celery <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/index.html>`__
   asynchronous class/function that is run in a separate process from
   the main Django LMS process. We have to serialize all data we send to
   a task to a string. In the Schedules app, a task is created for every
   bin of learners.

-  **Bin**: In the Schedules app, we divide the learners that we want to
   send emails to into N "bins" (default is 24). This is so that each
   Celery task only has to process approximately 1,000 emails each.

Running the Management Commands
-------------------------------

To initiate the celery tasks that query for users and then send emails,
run one of the management commands in the Schedules app. There is one
command per message type: ``send_recurring_nudge``,
``send_upgrade_reminder``, and ``send_course_update``.

The command requires you to specify for which Site to send emails. E.g.:

::

    ./manage.py lms send_recurring_nudge example.com

Make sure to specify the settings for the environment you are running
the management command in. For example, in docker devstack this would
be:

::

    ./manage.py lms --settings devstack_docker send_recurring_nudge example.com

You have the option to override the current date in order to run the
command as if it were run on that day.

::

    ./manage.py lms --settings devstack_docker send_recurring_nudge example.com --date 2017-11-13

If you have Sailthru configured in the current environment, you also
have the option to override the recipient email addresses so that all of
the emails are sent to the address that you specify instead of to the
users' emails.

::

    ./manage.py lms --settings devstack_docker send_recurring_nudge example.com --override-recipient-email developer@example.com

These management commands are intended to be run on a daily basis, so it
is recommended to execute them in a Cron job or Jenkins job scheduled to
run automatically every day.

Configuring A.C.E.
------------------

These instructions assume you have already setup an Open edX instance or
have a Running devstack. See the `Open edX Developer's
Guide <http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-developer-guide/en/latest/>`__
for information on how to set them up.

The Schedule app relies on ACE. ACE can be configured to send emails to
a file or send emails through Sailthru which actually delivers emails to
users.

File Back-end
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edit the ``lms/envs/common.py`` or ``lms/envs/private.py``\ and
add/change the following:

.. code:: python

    ACE_CHANNEL_SAILTHRU_DEBUG = True

By default your devstack should be configured to use the ``file_email``
ACE channel which saves the HTML emails to
``/path/to/your/devstack/src/ace_messages/*.html`` on your host (or
``/edx/src/ace_messages/`` in your devstack docker container). Open the
files in your browser to view the emails.

Sailthru Back-end
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure ACE to actually send emails to users' email addresses, add
a `Sailthru <http://www.sailthru.com/>`__ back-end configuration. See
the `edx-ace
documentation <https://edx-ace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#sailthruemailchannel-settings>`__
for instructions on setting up a Sailthru API key and secret.

Additionally, make sure these are set in either the
``lms/envs/common.py`` or ``lms/envs/private.py``:

.. code:: python

    ACE_CHANNEL_SAILTHRU_DEBUG = False
    ACE_ENABLED_CHANNEL = ['sailthru_email']
    ACE_ENABLED_POLICIES = ['bulk_email_optout']
    ACE_CHANNEL_SAILTHRU_TEMPLATE_NAME = '<insert_sailthru_template_name_here>'

Django Settings
---------------

Regardless of which ACE back-end you use, make sure to set the following
Django settings so that all of the features of the emails are enabled.

Edit the ``lms/envs/common.py`` or ``lms/envs/private.py`` and
add/change the following:

.. code:: python

    FEATURES = {
        'ENABLE_MKTG_SITE': True,
    }
    MKTG_URLS = {
        'ROOT': '<insert_lms_url_here>',
    }
    SOCIAL_MEDIA_FOOTER_URLS = {
        'tumblr': '<insert_tumblr_url_here>',
        'reddit': '<insert_reddit_url_here>',
        'twitter': '<insert_twitter_url_here>',
        'google_plus': '<insert_google_plus_url_here>',
        'youtube': '<insert_youtube_url_here>',
        'linkedin': '<insert_linkedin_url_here>',
        'meetup': '<insert_meetup_url_here>',
        'facebook': '<insert_facebook_url_here>',
    }
    MOBILE_STORE_URLS = {
        'google': '<insert_play_store_url_here>',
        'apple': '<insert_app_store_url_here>',
    }
    CONTACT_MAILING_ADDRESS = '<insert_physical_address_here>'

Configuration Flags
-------------------

Configuring Schedule Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure a Site has been created at ``<lms_url>/admin/sites/site``.

ScheduleConfig
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Django admin panel at
``<lms_url>/admin/schedules/scheduleconfig/`` create a ScheduleConfig
and link it to the Site. Make sure to enable all of the settings:

-  ``create_schedules``: enables creating new Schedules when new Course
   Enrollments are created.
-  ``hold_back_ratio``: ratio of all new Course Enrollments that should
   NOT have a Schedule created.

Roll-out Waffle Flag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is one roll-out related course waffle flag that we plan to delete
called ``schedules.create_schedules_for_course``, which, if the
``ScheduleConfig.create_schedules`` is disabled, will enable schedule
creation on a per-course basis.

Self-paced Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Schedules will only be created for a course if it is self-paced. A
course can be configured to be self-paced by going to
``<studio_url>/admin/self_paced/selfpacedconfiguration/`` and adding an
enabled self paced config. Then, go to Studio settings for the course
and change the Course Pacing value to "Self-Paced". Note that the Course
Start Date has to be set to sometime in the future in order to change
the Course Pacing.

Configuring Upgrade Deadline on Schedule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The upgrade reminder message type depends on there being a date in the
``upgrade_deadline`` field of the Schedule model. Up-sell messaging will
also be added to the recurring nudge and course updates message types
when an upgrade deadline date is present.

DynamicUpgradeDeadlineConfiguration models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to enable filling in the ``upgrade_deadline`` field of new
Schedule models created, you must create and enable one of the
following:

-  A DynamicUpgradeDeadlineConfiguration toggles the feature for all
   courses globally.
-  A OrgDynamicUpgradeDeadlineConfiguration toggles the feature for all
   courses in a particular organization.
-  A CourseDynamicUpgradeDeadlineConfiguration toggles the feature for a
   particular course.

The CourseDynamicUpgradeDeadlineConfiguration takes precedence over the
OrgDynamicUpgradeDeadlineConfiguration which takes precedence over the
global DynamicUpgradeDeadlineConfiguration.

The "deadline days" field specifies how many days from the day of the
learner's enrollment will be their soft upgrade deadline on the Schedule
model.

Verified Course Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``upgrade_deadline`` will only be filled for a course if it has a
verified course mode. To add a verified course mode to a course, go to
``<lms_url>/admin/course_modes/coursemode/`` and add a course mode
linked with the course with the "Mode" equal to "verified".

Configuring Email Sending
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ScheduleConfig
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ScheduleConfig model at
``<lms_url>/admin/schedules/scheduleconfig/`` also has fields which
configure enqueueing and delivering emails per message type:

-  ``enqueue_*``: allows sending email tasks of this message type to
   celery.
-  ``deliver_*``: allows delivering emails through ACE for this message
   type.

Roll-out Waffle Flag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another roll-out related course waffle flag that we plan to delete
called ``schedules.send_updates_for_course`` will enable sending
specifically the course updates email per-course.

Configuring Highlights UI in Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The button and modal on the course outline page that allows course
authors to enter section highlights can be toggled globally by going to
``<lms_url>/admin/waffle/switch/`` and adding an active switch called
``dynamic_pacing.studio_course_update``.

This is a roll-out related waffle switch that we will eventually delete.

Configuring a Learner's Schedule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Emails will only be sent to learners who have Schedule ``start_date``\ s
or ``upgrade_deadline``\ s and ScheduleExperience that match the
criteria for the message type.

Recurring Nudge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Learners must have the ScheduleExperience type of "Recurring Nudge
   and Upgrade Reminder".
-  Their Schedule ``start_date`` must be 3 or 10 days before the current
   date.

Upgrade Reminder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Learners must have the ScheduleExperience type of "Recurring Nudge
   and Upgrade Reminder".
-  Their Schedule ``upgrade_deadline`` must be 2 days after the current
   date.

Course Update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Learners must have the ScheduleExperience type of "Course Updates".
-  Their Schedule ``start_date`` must be 7, 14, or any increment of 7
   days up to 77 days before the current date.

Litmus
------

When designing email templates, it is important to test the rendered
emails in a variety of email clients to ensure there are no bugs in any
of them. EdX uses a tool called `Litmus <http://litmus.com/>`__ that
automates this process.

To begin using Litmus, make sure that ACE is configured to use Sailthru,
and then refer to the confluence page on `How to test emails in a
variety of
clients <https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RET/pages/216563991/How+to+test+emails+in+a+variety+of+clients>`__
which will explain how to send emails to Litmus using the
``--override-recipient-email`` option to the management commands.
