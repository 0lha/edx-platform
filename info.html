<h1>About 6.002</h1>

<p> 6.002 is designed to serve as a first course in an undergraduate
electrical engineering (EE), or electrical engineering and computer
science (EECS) curriculum. At MIT, 6.002 is in the core of department
subjects required for all undergraduates in EECS.

<p> The course introduces engineering in the context of the lumped
circuit abstraction. Topics covered include: resistive elements and
networks; independent and dependent sources; switches and MOS
transistors; digital abstraction; amplifiers; energy storage elements;
dynamics of first- and second-order networks; design in the time and
frequency domains; and analog and digital circuits and
applications. Design and lab exercises are also significant components
of the course. 6.002 is worth 4 Engineering Design Points. The 6.002
content was created collaboratively by Profs. Anant Agarwal and
Jeffrey H. Lang.

<p> The course uses the textbook Foundations of Analog and Digital
Electronic Circuits. Agarwal, Anant, and Jeffrey H. Lang. San Mateo,
CA: Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Elsevier, July 2005. ISBN:
9781558607354. While recommended, the book is not required -- relevant
section will be provided electronically as part of the on-line course.

<h1> Requirements </h1> 

<p> Students entering the course are expected to know how basic
calculus and differential equations, as well as basic linear
algebra. In addition, a background in E&amp;M is helpful, although not
critical.

<p> The course web site was developed and tested primarily with Google
Chrome. We support Mozilla Firefox as well. While we will attempt to
make it possible to complete the course with Internet Explorer,
portions of the web site functionality will be unavailable. The videos
require Flash.
