    "SPEAKER 1: In this unit, we're going to study several new", 
    "tools in our tool chest. These include the superposition", 
    "method, the Thevenin method, and the Norton method.", 
    "The recommended reading is chapter three of the textbook.", 
    "", 
    "Before we begin, let's do a quick review of what we've", 
    "seen so far.", 
    "So recall we've been building up our tool chest, a tool", 
    "chest of techniques that can analyze circuits.", 
    "We've seen several.", 
    "First, we've seen the KVL/KCL method, where, given the", 
    "KVL/KCL rules, you would write a bunch of equations to", 
    "circuits and go and solve them.", 
    "Then, you looked at the circuit composition rules", 
    "method, where you simplified circuits into more composed", 
    "circuits and analyzed them much more simply.", 
    "The third method was the Node method.", 
    "The Node method is the workhorse of 6.002 and pretty", 
    "much all of circuit analysis.", 
    "The key idea behind the Node method is that KCL at the", 
    "nodes is applied using all voltages referenced to ground,", 
    "where the ground is taken as zero.", 
    "That enables substantial simplicity in", 
    "how the Node method--", 
    "in how the rules are applied, giving you way better and", 
    "efficient techniques.", 
    "So these are three methods in your tool chest.", 
    "So today, we are going to look at how to build up your tool", 
    "chest. And I'm going to introduce a new technique, or", 
    "a set of two techniques, the superposition method, the", 
    "Thevenin method, and the Norton method.", 
    "I'll start with the superposition method.", 
    "Now, these methods apply only to linear circuits.", 
    "Now recall, when we did the analysis of various circuits--", 
    "recall that we had looked at this playground of ours.", 
    "And in this playground, all our techniques applied.", 
    "Now it turns out, there's a region of the playground in", 
    "which circuits are linear.", 
    "It's a subset of the playground.", 
    "Within this playground, some extremely", 
    "powerful tools apply.", 
    "Imagine that, within this playground, you are able to", 
    "use a bazooka as a weapon, while you can't use it outside", 
    "this little piece of playground.", 
    "This subset of the playground that we've been used to so far", 
    "is the playground containing only linear circuits.", 
    "So in this unit, I would like to introduce linear circuits.", 
    "Then I'll talk about the properties of linearity.", 
    "What does it buy us?", 
    "And then I will talk about the superposition method.", 
    "The superposition method applies", 
    "only for linear circuits.", 
    "And we'll look at how that can substantially", 
    "simplify circuit analysis.", 
    "So in this video segment, let's start with introducing", 
    "linear circuits.", 
    "", 
    "I would like to introduce a technique with an example.", 
    "", 
    "This is a very simple circuit containing two sources, the", 
    "voltage source and the current source.", 
    "I'm going to apply the Node method to analyze this.", 
    "So according to the Node method, I am going to start", 
    "with introducing a ground node.", 
    "So I want to pick this node as my ground node.", 
    "And the reason I'm doing that is, as is our usual practice,", 
    "this ground node connects to one terminal of both of our", 
    "sources, and many edges of the circuit come", 
    "together at that point.", 
    "", 
    "The voltage at this node here is V, because there's a", 
    "voltage source connected there.", 
    "And the voltage at this node is labeled e. e is my unknown.", 
    "And my goal is to find e.", 
    "", 
    "So how do I apply the Node method?", 
    "", 
    "I'm going to start by adding a node equation for the node e.", 
    "", 
    "So here is my node equation.", 
    "How do I get that?", 
    "Let's look at the first term.", 
    "", 
    "The first term, e minus V divided by", 
    "R1, arises as follows.", 
    "So recall, I have to apply KCL at the node with voltage e,", 
    "and sum the currents coming into the node,", 
    "and set them to 0.", 
    "So--", 
    "I'm sorry.", 
    "I'm summing the currents leaving the node and setting", 
    "them to be 0.", 
    "I could do either.", 
    "So there's a current leaving this node in this direction.", 
    "In that direction, the current leaving that node is e minus", 
    "the voltage V divided by R1.", 
    "So it's e minus V divided by R1 is the current", 
    "leaving this node.", 
    "The current leaving this node through R2 is simply e divided", 
    "by R2, and that's this piece.", 
    "Finally, the current leaving this node in this direction is", 
    "simply minus I. And these three currents sum to 0.", 
    "OK.", 
    "That gives us the node equation, or the", 
    "node at voltage e.", 
    "You've already noticed some very interesting things in", 
    "this equation.", 
    "notice that the equation is linear in e, V, and I. Notice", 
    "that you don't see any terms involving the product eV, or V", 
    "squared, VI, and so on.", 
    "So [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]", 
    "this equation is linear in e, V, and I.", 
    "Let's go on and stir this equation a little more.", 
    "And I'm going to rearrange the terms.", 
    "So I take this equation--", 
    "", 
    "I'm going to take this equation and rearrange the", 
    "terms a little bit.", 
    "And if you look at the equation here, 1 by R1, is", 
    "multiplying the inverse.", 
    "We divide by R1.", 
    "", 
    "And that's shown here.", 
    "And then, similarly, 1 divided by R2 is multiplying e here.", 
    "And I show that here.", 
    "I move I to the right hand side, so that's here.", 
    "Similarly, we divide by R1.", 
    "Shows up here.", 
    "So by rearranging terms, I show the unknown voltage e to", 
    "be some function of the voltages V and I.", 
    "This turned out to be a canonic", 
    "representation of equations.", 
    "And in this representation, in this case, I", 
    "have a single voltage.", 
    "But in general, this could be multiple voltages, which I", 
    "could collect into a matrix form", 
    "This matrix here is called the conductance matrix.", 
    "I could stick my vector of node voltages here.", 
    "And on the right hand side, I have a linear sum of sources,", 
    "where V and I are my voltage and current sources,", 
    "respectively.", 
    "", 
    "In matrix form, this matrix is commonly called G. The vector", 
    "of unknown voltages is called e.", 
    "And on the right hand side, I have the", 
    "linear sum of sources.", 
    "", 
    "So let's take it one step further.", 
    "And in this equation, here is what I am doing.", 
    "I have taken this component and I have moved it over to", 
    "the right hand side, exposing e all by itself.", 
    "OK.", 
    "As I simplify the equation, here is what I get.", 
    "Notice that when I move this to the side, my V here is now", 
    "multiplied by R2 divided by R1 plus R2.", 
    "And I is multiplied by R1 and R2 divided by R1 plus R2.", 
    "So all I've done here is taken this part and simply moved it", 
    "to the right hand side and divided the right", 
    "hand side with that.", 
    "And this is what I get.", 
    "This should make it very clear that my unknown node voltage e", 
    "is a straight linear--", 
    "is a linear sum of the sources.", 
    "V is my source.", 
    "I is a source.", 
    "And I have some constant multiplier", 
    "multiplying those voltages.", 
    "So this should make it clear that this is a constant.", 
    "This is a constant.", 
    "And I have a V and a I, and so I get a linear sum of sources.", 
    "", 
    "I can do it a little bit more clearly.", 
    "Looks like I've scribbled around, unfortunately, so", 
    "let's see if this eraser thingy works.", 
    "Ah.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "That works pretty nicely.", 
    "And let me get some color back into my pen here.", 
    "And so notice that in general, for any circuit, any node", 
    "voltage e can be represented as a linear combination of all", 
    "the sources, whether they're voltage", 
    "sources or current sources.",
