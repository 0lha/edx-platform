    "SPEAKER 1: All right, let's begin by building a tool chest", 
    "of our analysis techniques.", 
    "But before we begin, it would worth while asking the", 
    "question, what does it mean to analyze a circuit?", 
    "Well analyzing a circuit simply means find all the", 
    "element v's and i's.", 
    "In other words, find all the branch variables.", 
    "And so what are these branch variables?", 
    "Well if you look at element R1, I can write its branch", 
    "variables as plus minus v1 here, so the", 
    "voltage across R1.", 
    "And I can assign a current i.", 
    "And for R4, as an example, I can say there's", 
    "v4 and there's i4.", 
    "And in general I'm pretty free to assign voltage and currents", 
    "in any direction.", 
    "But you will notice that I'm going to follow a discipline", 
    "where I'm going to draw the current entering into the", 
    "positive terminal.", 
    "And I will show you why in a quick second.", 
    "So as another example, I can define the element value for v", 
    "for the voltage source.", 
    "The branch variables here would be v0 and a current i0", 
    "going here.", 
    "And so on and so forth and I can do the", 
    "same for all the elements.", 
    "So analyzing a circuit really means go find all the element", 
    "v's and i's for the circuit.", 
    "Now we're ready to start with our analysis techniques that", 
    "will go into our tool chest. The first method that we will", 
    "look at is called a very basic KVL, KCL", 
    "method of circuit analysis.", 
    "And as I mentioned earlier, our goal with circuit analysis", 
    "is to find all the element v's and i's.", 
    "The KVL, KCL method is extremely simple.", 
    "In the first step in this method, you take your circuit", 
    "and you write down for each element their v-i", 
    "relationships.", 
    "Then, the second step, you pick all the nodes and for", 
    "each node you write KCL.", 
    "Then as a third step, you go through the loops one by one", 
    "and you write KVL for each of the nodes.", 
    "Notice that each of these equations is a very simple", 
    "equation containing simple algebraic expressions of the", 
    "currents and the voltages.", 
    "Now you'll end up with lots and lots of equations and you", 
    "will have lots of fun solving them.", 
    "Let's take a look at an example.", 
    "So our goal, as I said earlier, was to find all", 
    "elements v's and i's.", 
    "Now before we go in and do an example of using the KVL, KCL", 
    "method, I want to spend 30 seconds telling you about a", 
    "couple of ideas on how to label element v's and i's.", 
    "So for example, here's an element, the", 
    "Element e in some circuit.", 
    "And notice it has a v and an i.", 
    "In general, what we're going to do is we are going to", 
    "follow a little discipline or a little convention in how we", 
    "assign the voltage and currents.", 
    "Specifically, we are going to take the current to be", 
    "positive going into the positive voltage terminal", 
    "So in this case, here is the positive voltage terminal of", 
    "the Element e.", 
    "And so we're going to be assigning currents to be going", 
    "into the positive voltage terminal.", 
    "Now you can do whatever you want, it", 
    "really doesn't matter.", 
    "You can go and assign currents and voltages any which way and", 
    "reverse them and KVL, KCL will simply work.", 
    "It just turns out that in a lot of what we do in circuits", 
    "and electronics, it is useful to follow conventions so that", 
    "you don't make silly algebraic mistakes.", 
    "So whenever you have a choice of being able to do something", 
    "10 different ways, it is just good to be disciplined and use", 
    "one technique all the time so that you", 
    "just don't make mistakes.", 
    "Now one benefit of taking the current to be going into the", 
    "positive terminal of the element is that the power", 
    "consumed by the element, which is given by vi, is positive.", 
    "So if you choose your convention of the current", 
    "going into the positive terminal, then the power", 
    "consumed by the element, vi, is going to be positive.", 
    "So this way, or this convention, of assigning", 
    "voltage and currents as the branch variables is called the", 
    "associated variables discipline.", 
    "And again, as with all disciplines, it's something we", 
    "impose on ourselves, it's a convention.", 
    "We just follow this convention to simplify our lives and to", 
    "reduce the chance that we're going to make mistakes.", 
    "And if you don't like this, don't worry, go ahead, make my", 
    "day, pick different convention for v and i, just be careful.", 
    "If you follow this convention, it is less likely you will", 
    "make mistakes.", 
    "Now before we actually begin the KVL method, there is one", 
    "more thing that I need to quickly cover which is a few", 
    "elements relationships.", 
    "So you have seen resistors before.", 
    "So for a resistor with the resistance value R, the v-i", 
    "relationship is simply given by v equals iR.", 
    "Where if this is my voltage v, and the", 
    "current i, v equals iR.", 
    "Next, for our voltage source, let me draw out a voltage", 
    "source with voltage V0 in this case.", 
    "And let me assign branch variable, v plus v and v, and", 
    "the current i.", 
    "Then the element relationship, v is given by V0.", 
    "One of the places where I find students getting confused is", 
    "the difference between element values and the", 
    "component value itself.", 
    "So if you look at a voltage source of this sort, V0 is a", 
    "property or this voltage source.", 
    "So if it's a battery, it might supply a", 
    "voltage V0 of 1.5 volts.", 
    "However, when I take this voltage source and I put that", 
    "into a circuit, with the circuit it's going to draw", 
    "some current i and there will be some voltage across it.", 
    "If there's a resistor, it will be some of the voltage.", 
    "But if I put an ideal voltage source with internal voltage", 
    "V0 and I stick that into a circuit, then the branch", 
    "variable v associated with that will also be equal to V0.", 
    "But in general, that doesn't have to be true.", 
    "Next, let me go to a current source.", 
    "In this case, I would define my current source like so.", 
    "I can also apply branch variables v and i.", 
    "And the equation, if the current source supplies a", 
    "current I0, then the element relationship for this is given", 
    "by i equals I0.", 
    "So these are three examples of element relationships for", 
    "resistors, voltage sources, and current sources.", 
    "OK, we are done with the preamble.", 
    "We are now all set to dive into method one of circuit", 
    "analysis, the KVL, KCL method.", 
    "So let's apply this method to the demo circuit", 
    "that we used earlier.", 
    "And let's see how we can find out all the", 
    "element v's and i's.", 
    "Now recall, the KVL, KCL method said, in fact circuit", 
    "analysis said, that solving a circuit involves finding all", 
    "the element v's and i's.", 
    "So why don't we start this example with labeling all the", 
    "v's and i's for our demo circuit.", 
    "OK, so let's get started and very quickly label all the", 
    "branch variables.", 
    "And I'm going to to follow the associated variable discipline", 
    "in doing that.", 
    "So let me start by labelling all the branch variables.", 
    "Let me call this v0, current is i0 coming in here.", 
    "Let me call this v1 and let me say this is current i1.", 
    "Let me say this is v4, current i4.", 
    "Let me say this is v3 and current i3.", 
    "Let me then say that this guy here is v5 and current is i5.", 
    "In this case, it's v2 and the current is i2.", 
    "So I have a bunch of branch variables assigned.", 
    "And I also have these branch variables involved with the", 
    "currents and voltages.", 
    "And notice here that in this example I have used the", 
    "associated variable discipline, that I have", 
    "assigned all my currents flowing into the positive", 
    "terminal of each of the assigned branch voltages.", 
    "So here I get 12 unknowns in all.", 
    "If we count v0, v1, v2, v3, v4, and v5, that's 6.", 
    "And i0 through i5, that's another 6, so I have a total", 
    "of 12 unknowns.", 
    "Also notice that is a is a node, b is a node, c is a", 
    "node, and d is a node.", 
    "And so those are my nodes.", 
    "I will be writing KCL for those nodes.", 
    "And then I have a bunch of loops.", 
    "So what are my loops here?", 
    "So I have a loop L1, I have a loop L2, I have a loop L3.", 
    "Now I claim there is one more loop.", 
    "Like let me pause here for a second and have you think", 
    "about where that fourth loop is."
