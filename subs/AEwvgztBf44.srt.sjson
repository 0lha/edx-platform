    "ANANT AGARWAL: So let me give you an example of a bunch of", 
    "interesting lumped elements and then show you a couple of", 
    "really nasty lumped elements.", 
    "LORENZO: I'm going to switch to the other one.", 
    "I made a mistake.", 
    "ANANT AGARWAL: So what you see out here, so we characterize", 
    "lumped elements by the vi characteristics, OK?", 
    "You apply a voltage, measure the current, So what I can do", 
    "is I can plot i here and v here and see", 
    "what it looks like.", 
    "I can characterize elements by their vi relationship, and", 
    "there are a bunch of elements that I can create based on the", 
    "vi relationship.", 
    "So let me show you a few examples.", 
    "So for the resistor, since v is directly proportional to i,", 
    "and r is the constant, I get a straight line.", 
    "That's the i-axis, the v-axis, and this is a resistor.", 
    "What I actually have is a variable resistor, so I'm", 
    "going to change the resistance value r, and the curve will", 
    "also change slope.", 
    "I change the value r because it's a variable resistor, and", 
    "it changes slope because my r is different.", 
    "Next, let me go to--", 
    "LORENZO: Fixed.", 
    "ANANT AGARWAL: --a fixed resistor, and this guy here on", 
    "the screen to your left, I guess, is a fixed resistor.", 
    "And you see that its iv characteristic is a line of a", 
    "given slope, 1 by r, and that's it.", 
    "I can't change it.", 
    "Number three, I have another lumped element, called a Zener", 
    "diode, that you will see in the fourth week of this class.", 
    "And the characteristics for the Zener", 
    "diode look like this--", 
    "i, v. If my voltage goes across, that Zener diode goes", 
    "up slightly, the current shoots up.", 
    "But if the voltage becomes negative, I don't have any", 
    "current flowing through it until the voltage passes some", 
    "threshold, at which point my current begins to build up.", 
    "So you can increase voltage a little bit, and you can show", 
    "that the current starts building up again.", 
    "So that's another interesting lumped element", 
    "called a Zener diode.", 
    "Let's switch to the next one called a diode.", 
    "So a diode looks like this--", 
    "i, v. If the voltage across the diode becomes positive,", 
    "around 0.6 volts or thereabout, the current begins", 
    "to shoot up.", 
    "But if the voltage is below that threshold of 0.6, then my", 
    "current is almost zero.", 
    "It's another lumped element called a diode.", 
    "And you will begin using these elements in your 002 lives to", 
    "build interesting systems.", 
    "Next example is a thermistor.", 
    "A thermistor is a resistor whose resistance varies with", 
    "temperature, OK?", 
    "So this is a very expensive little drier, hair drier.", 
    "And what I'm going to do is blow some hot air at my", 
    "resistor, and you're going to see that its value is going to", 
    "change depending on how much I heat it.", 
    "As it cools down--", 
    "let me cool it down.", 
    "So you can see it's coming down.", 
    "I can zap it again.", 
    "[TURNS ON DRYER]", 
    "ANANT AGARWAL: I could do this all day.", 
    "This is so much fun.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "ANANT AGARWAL: OK, so that's a another", 
    "interesting lumped element.", 
    "As the temperature rises, its resistance changes.", 
    "LORENZO: Photo.", 
    "ANANT AGARWAL: Next thing is called a photoresistor.", 
    "It's a resistor.", 
    "It used to be a resistor, Lorenzo?", 
    "LORENZO: Yeah.", 
    "OK, that's fine.", 
    "ANANT AGARWAL: So this is a photoresistor.", 
    "And notice that it almost behaves like an open circuit.", 
    "Well, what I'm going to do is shine some light on it.", 
    "When I shine light on it, it begins to conduct and becomes", 
    "a resistor of some value.", 
    "There you go, OK?", 
    "So that's a photoresistor.", 
    "LORENZO: Now, we go to the--", 
    "ANANT AGARWAL: So now I'm going to show you a battery.", 
    "Notice, we didn't talk about batteries before.", 
    "I'll show you a battery.", 
    "So before we show a battery, just think in your own minds,", 
    "what should the iv characteristic of a", 
    "battery look like?", 
    "i, v, a battery supplies a constant voltage.", 
    "You know, your little cell, your double A", 
    "battery, 1.5 volts?", 
    "So think about what the iv characteristic of a battery", 
    "should look like for three seconds before", 
    "I show it to you.", 
    "And so I show it, Lorenzo.", 
    "It's a straight line.", 
    "This is a good battery.", 
    "It's a straight vertical line, which says that the voltage is", 
    "1.5 volts or thereabouts no matter", 
    "what current it supplies.", 
    "As an ideal voltage source, it as a fixed voltage v no matter", 
    "what the current going through it is.", 
    "Now I'll show you a dud, a bad battery.", 
    "And this is what the bad battery looks like.", 
    "So many of you had a your car batteries die on you, and when", 
    "you go to the store, they check your batteries.", 
    "They use exactly this principle, that dead batteries", 
    "have resistance.", 
    "Whenever you see slopes here, you're thinking of resistance,", 
    "They can use this property to figure out that", 
    "your battery is dead.", 
    "So that's a dead battery.", 
    "And finally, let me show you a bulb.", 
    "We started with a bulb, and so I need to end--", 
    "OK.", 
    "We started with a bulb, so we need to end with a bulb.", 
    "And what you'll see is that a bulb is simply--", 
    "behaves like a resistor.", 
    "It's iv curve is going to look like this.", 
    "OK, notice, this is my bulb, and guess what?", 
    "It behaves like a resistor.", 
    "It's a very interesting kind of resistor.", 
    "So I won't go into details for now, but notice its iv", 
    "characteristic behaves like a resistor, OK?", 
    "So those are some pretty standard lumped elements.", 
    "You'll deal with a lot more set of lumped elements--", 
    "switches, MOFETs, capacitors, inductors, a bunch", 
    "of other fun stuff.", 
    "But before we do that, what I wanted to tell you is that", 
    "don't go berserk on this abstraction binge, OK?", 
    "Too much of anything is bad for you.", 
    "So what I'm going to show you is abstractions or models are", 
    "only valid provided you work within a set of constraints.", 
    "Notice, we've already had this tacit handshake, which said", 
    "that we'll follow the discipline, OK?", 
    "Even after we follow the discipline, there are ranges", 
    "to how well physical elements can behave like", 
    "ideal lumped elements.", 
    "For example, what I'm going to do is show you as a resistor.", 
    "And it's going to look like a resistor, and I'm going to", 
    "keep the voltage around it.", 
    "What's going to happen at some point?", 
    "I just keep doing that.", 
    "If it's an ideal element, if you're a theorist, you'll say,", 
    "oh yeah, the curve will keep extending", 
    "until I reach infinity.", 
    "But this is a practical resistor, so, you know.", 
    "The people out here, you're going to have to cover your", 
    "eyes or something.", 
    "So your abstraction can predict that.", 
    "It says the current is an amp.", 
    "It can predict the heat, light, or the smell.", 
    "Because in the laboratory, when you get the smell, you", 
    "know what somebody has just done.", 
    "They blown the resistor.", 
    "So that's one example of a lumped", 
    "abstraction breaking down.", 
    "So if I really believe in my own BS, anything's a lumped", 
    "element, so here's a pickle.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "ANANT AGARWAL: A pickle's a lumped element.", 
    "I can treat it as a lumped resistor.", 
    "But this is a very interesting lumped resistor.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "ANANT AGARWAL: Don't try this at home.", 
    "This is a standard pickle into which we are", 
    "pumping 110 volts AC.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "ANANT AGARWAL: I promise you, this is a standard pickle.", 
    "So as you can tell, it has a fixed resistance, but your", 
    "lumped abstraction cannot predict the nice light and", 
    "sound effect.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]"
