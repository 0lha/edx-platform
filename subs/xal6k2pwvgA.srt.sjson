    "PROFESSOR: In this segment, we will develop a second method", 
    "that will work for linear circuits.", 
    "This method is called the Thevenin method, and its", 
    "complementary method, the Norton method.", 
    "So in order to develop this method for linear circuits,", 
    "suppose you have some arbitrary network, N. And", 
    "let's say in this arbitrary network you have a whole bunch", 
    "of resistors, you have a whole bunch of voltage sources, Vm,", 
    "and a whole bunch of current sources as well.", 
    "OK, so you have a bunch of voltage sources.", 
    "And these are all independent voltage sources for now.", 
    "V1, V2, V3, all the way through VM.", 
    "You have a whole bunch of current sources, I1, I2, I3,", 
    "all the way through to In.", 
    "Suppose I am interested in applying some kind of", 
    "excitation due to an external current source with current i.", 
    "And let us say that all I care to do is to determine the", 
    "voltage, V. So the setup here is I have an arbitrary", 
    "network, N, with a ton of resistors and voltage sources", 
    "and current sources, all independent.", 
    "And I apply an external excitation, and", 
    "it's a current i.", 
    "And just assume that all I want to do is to determine the", 
    "voltage, V. Assume that I don't care about any internal", 
    "voltages, Vi, or any internal currents, Ij, and so on.", 
    "Let's say I don't care about any of", 
    "those internal currents.", 
    "All I care about is the voltage, V.", 
    "So in a situation like this where you care about some", 
    "voltage or current at some point, you can use the", 
    "property of linearity and the resulting superposition", 
    "property to develop an extremely powerful method to", 
    "get you to your answer very quickly.", 
    "So in order to develop this method, let me use the", 
    "superposition technique and try to figure out the voltage,", 
    "V. So the voltage V will be some combination of the linear", 
    "sources in this linear circuit.", 
    "So let's say, for example, I want to figure out the", 
    "contribution to the voltage V due to the voltage source, Vm.", 
    "What I would then do is I would set i to 0, I would set", 
    "all the currents, I1 through In, to 0, and I would set all", 
    "the voltages, V1 through Vm minus 1, to 0 as well, and", 
    "just look at the impact on V due to Vm acting alone.", 
    "So the impact on V due to Vm acting alone, and notice that", 
    "once all the currents have been turned off and all the", 
    "other voltages have been turned off, I'm left with a", 
    "big resistor network.", 
    "And I'm going to get some multiplier here.", 
    "Let's label that alpha m.", 
    "So that will be the result of the source Vm acting alone on", 
    "the output voltage, V.", 
    "Similarly, I can do the same thing for all the voltages.", 
    "I can do it for V1 acting alone.", 
    "I can do it for V2 acting alone, and so on and so forth.", 
    "For each of those voltages, V1, V2, and so on, I get a", 
    "term that looks like this.", 
    "I get alpha 1 V1, alpha 2 V2, and so on and so forth, all", 
    "the way through alpha m Vm.", 
    "And so what I get is a sum over m of all of these terms.", 
    "By applying V1 acting alone and V2 acting alone and so on,", 
    "I get a term, alpha 1 V1, alpha 2 V2, and so on.", 
    "Next, I'll move on to the currents, and in this case,", 
    "supposing I set all the currents, say, for In--", 
    "I'm going to set the small i to 0, and I'm going to set all", 
    "the Vm's to 0, and I'm going to set all the currents, I1", 
    "through In minus 1, to 0.", 
    "So in that situation, I'm going to get some factor, Bn,", 
    "that applies to In.", 
    "So I've got some factor Bn, beta n, that applies to In.", 
    "And that is the result of In acting alone.", 
    "Similarly, I can have I1 acting alone, I2 acting alone,", 
    "and so on, and for each of them, I get a term, beta 1 I1", 
    "plus beta 2 I2 and so on and so forth.", 
    "And I sum them all up as well over all n.", 
    "So with i acting alone, I'm going to set all of the other", 
    "In's and Vm's to 0, and just have i acting alone.", 
    "And so therefore I will get an i, and I'm going to have some", 
    "multiplier.", 
    "And in this case, notice that when all the Vm's and all the", 
    "In's are set to 0, I'm just left with a big resistor", 
    "network here.", 
    "And so it will look like a big effective resistor looking", 
    "into this port.", 
    "And so let me write that down as some R multiplied", 
    "by the current i.", 
    "So notice now that the voltage V is a sum of a bunch of", 
    "components that arise from the voltages acting alone, the", 
    "currents acting alone, and also the external excitation", 
    "acting alone.", 
    "And just recall, how did I get this?", 
    "How did I get each of these terms?", 
    "So this term which sums up all the voltages I got by setting", 
    "all the In's to 0 and by setting the external", 
    "excitation to 0.", 
    "Similarly, I got the second term here by setting all the", 
    "voltage sources to 0, and also by setting the external", 
    "excitation to 0.", 
    "And finally, this last term, I got that by setting all the", 
    "currents to 0 and all the voltages to 0.", 
    "So what we're going to do now is by using this insight,", 
    "we're going to build up a new technique.", 
    "And to give you a preview to that technique, I'm going to", 
    "show you a trick that will enable you to replace this", 
    "network, N, by something very, very simple.", 
    "In fact, I'm going to show you that we're going to be able to", 
    "replace that entire network by some voltage source and some", 
    "resistor acting in series.", 
    "And this will be able to replace this entire network,", 
    "N, for the purpose of computing the voltage, V. So", 
    "just think of that as a preview of upcoming", 
    "attractions.", 
    "So moving on, let's take a look at the equation that we", 
    "just developed and understand that a little bit more.", 
    "So if you look at the equation here that we developed, V is", 
    "some component related to Vm's, some component related", 
    "to In's, and some component related to the external", 
    "excitation, i.", 
    "So if you look at this term here, if you look at the alpha", 
    "m term here, that has no units.", 
    "It has no units because I have a voltage on the left-hand", 
    "side and it's multiplying a voltage.", 
    "Similarly, beta and In must result in a voltage, and so", 
    "therefore beta n must have resistance units.", 
    "And then similarly, R that is multiplying i must have", 
    "resistance units as well.", 
    "So notice that if you look at the Vm-related term and the", 
    "In-related term, then what you see is that together they are", 
    "independent of the external excitation, and the behave", 
    "like a voltage.", 
    "Similarly, if you look at the right-hand term here, Ri,", 
    "that's a resistance multiplied by a current, and of course,", 
    "that also has resulting voltage units.", 
    "So let's look at the first part here, the part comprising", 
    "the Vm's and the In's.", 
    "That behaves like a voltage, and it is independent of", 
    "external excitation.", 
    "And so what I'm going to do is I am going to call it VTH.", 
    "And don't worry about why I'm calling it VTH right now, but", 
    "let's assume that I call it VTH.", 
    "So that's a first component that is independent of", 
    "external excitation and behaves like a voltage.", 
    "Now if you look at the second component, as I said earlier,", 
    "the second component clearly depends on the current, i.", 
    "But if you look at the multiplier R, then that is", 
    "also independent of external excitation and", 
    "behaves like a resistor.", 
    "So let's call that RTH.", 
    "So again, if you look at the term that gives you V, it will", 
    "now comprise a portion that we've called VTH.", 
    "And it has a second component that relates to the external", 
    "excitation, i, by is multiplied by something we", 
    "call RTH, where the RTH is independent of the external", 
    "excitation, i.", 
    "So what I've just done is I've written down the excitation as", 
    "a sum of a voltage here that I decided to call VTH, and I've", 
    "also said that the second part is RTH times i.", 
    "And that is equal to the voltage, V. So notice V equals", 
    "VTH plus RTH i.", 
    "So in other words, if you look at this expression here, as", 
    "far as the external world is concerned-- and again, for the", 
    "purpose of computing the voltage, our network N is", 
    "completely indistinguishable from another network.", 
    "What does that network look like?", 
    "So this whole network, N, can be replaced by the following", 
    "network that I'm going to show you in a quick second.", 
    "So I have a voltage, VTH, here, and I have", 
    "a resistance, RTH.", 
    "And this is my voltage, V. And what I've done here is,", 
    "according to this equation, V equals VTH plus RTH i--", 
    "I have simply expressed that in circuit form as a little", 
    "pattern showing a VTH and then with an RTH in series.", 
    "And this is easy to see, that when i is 0, the voltage at", 
    "the output here is VTH.", 
    "And then if I have a short circuit where V is 0, then the", 
    "current through that short circuit will simply be given", 
    "by VTH divided by RTH.", 
    "And so this little pattern here can now replace my", 
    "network N for the purpose of computing V.", 
    "This network is called the Thevenin equivalent network.", 
    "And so I can take this network, replace the arbitrary", 
    "network N with this network, the Thevenin equivalent", 
    "network, and then I can connect my external", 
    "excitation, i, and then compute the voltage V that", 
    "appears across the terminals.", 
    "In other words, what I've done is, using the Thevenin method,", 
    "I can take an arbitrary network N. I can figure out", 
    "the VTH and RTH that relate solely to that network's", 
    "properties, and then replace that network with", 
    "VTH and RTH in series.", 
    "And the series connection is called the", 
    "Thevenin equivalent network.", 
    "So you will see this is another pattern.", 
    "This is called the Thevenin pattern.", 
    "So in circuits and electronics courses, you will see the", 
    "Thevenin pattern very often.", 
    "And in this pattern, you have a voltage source in series", 
    "with a resistor.", 
    "And again, it's easy to see that when you have I being 0,", 
    "then the Thevenin voltage, VTH, appears at the output", 
    "terminal as a VTH.", 
    "And similarly, if you short the terminal pair here where V", 
    "is 0, then your current is going to be given by the", 
    "expression, VTH divided by RTH.", 
    "And since the current is going to be in the direction", 
    "opposite to this current, i, there will be a negative.", 
    "But essentially you can see why this expression, V equals", 
    "VTH plus RTH i, directly relates to the Thevenin", 
    "pattern with the voltage source in series with the", 
    "resistance."
