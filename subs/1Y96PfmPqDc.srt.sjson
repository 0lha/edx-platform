    "INSTRUCTOR: Based on the previous method or the", 
    "previous property that you saw for linear circuits, we are", 
    "now ready to define the superposition method for", 
    "circuit analysis.", 
    "Note that the superposition method", 
    "applies to linear circuits.", 
    "And again, to refresh your memory, remember, we are in", 
    "the EECS playground that we got into by adhering to the", 
    "lumped matter discipline.", 
    "And within that, we looked at the node method and the KVL", 
    "KCL method that applies all over the EECS playground.", 
    "And then what we'll now do is look at some methods that will", 
    "apply to only a region of this playground where linear", 
    "circuits reside.", 
    "So the first of these methods is the superposition method.", 
    "And again, it applies to linear circuits.", 
    "So the method is very simple and inspired by the", 
    "superposition property that we studied for linear circuits.", 
    "So the method simply says this.", 
    "You first find the responses of the circuit to each source", 
    "acting alone.", 
    "Think of this as a divide and conquer method where you take", 
    "your entire circuit, and you find the responses of the", 
    "circuit to each source acting alone.", 
    "You turn off all the sources, and you find the response to", 
    "each source acting alone.", 
    "Then what you do is simply sum those individual responses.", 
    "Note that this technique applies to", 
    "independent sources only.", 
    "So if I have a linear circuit, then this technique applies to", 
    "independent sources only.", 
    "Now we will look at what happens when you have", 
    "dependent sources and so on in later lectures.", 
    "OK, let's move ahead.", 
    "The first step was find the response of the circuit to", 
    "each source acting alone.", 
    "But what does it mean for each source to act alone?", 
    "What it means is that you turn off all the other sources.", 
    "So for example, suppose we are focused on a", 
    "voltage source here.", 
    "What does it mean to turn off this voltage source?", 
    "In other words, if I want to set this voltage to 0, what", 
    "does it mean in terms of my circuit?", 
    "So in terms of my circuit, what this means is that I am", 
    "going to short the source.", 
    "So what you do is you short the source, and you end up", 
    "with a short circuit here.", 
    "And that is my voltage source having been set to 0.", 
    "And so I take all my voltage sources in the circuit and", 
    "simply short them out.", 
    "And this would be making each of the sources to act alone.", 
    "OK, next let's look at a current source and see what it", 
    "means to set a current source to 0.", 
    "So in this case, what you do is much as you set a voltage", 
    "source to 0 by shorting it out, you set the current", 
    "source to 0 by open-circuiting it like so.", 
    "So you create an open circuit in place of the current", 
    "source, and that's what it means to set a", 
    "current source to zero.", 
    "OK, so now we are ready to go try out an example using the", 
    "method of superposition.", 
    "And again, remember the method of superposition has", 
    "two parts to it.", 
    "In the first part, you find the responses of the circuit", 
    "to each source acting alone.", 
    "And then second, you sum up the partial responses.", 
    "So let's go back to our old faithful example.", 
    "In this example, we have two sources, a voltage source and", 
    "a current source.", 
    "And let's say our goal is to find the node voltage e taken", 
    "with respect to this ground.", 
    "And we are going to use the superposition", 
    "method to do the circuit.", 
    "So I showed the circuit on the right-hand corner here.", 
    "And notice that e is the node voltage that I", 
    "need to figure out.", 
    "So by the superposition method, I have two steps.", 
    "My first step is find the responses of the circuit to", 
    "each source acting alone.", 
    "So what I'm going to do is let me start with finding the", 
    "response of the circuit to the voltage source acting alone.", 
    "So what do I do to get a subcircuit in which the", 
    "voltage source is acting alone?", 
    "So I want you to think about this and try to figure out", 
    "what the resulting subcircuit is going to look like.", 
    "I'll give you a few seconds to do that before I do it myself.", 
    "All right.", 
    "This is the subcircuit.", 
    "And what I've done here is I've had to turn the current", 
    "source off.", 
    "So notice that out here I create an open circuit, and", 
    "that is the result of my current source", 
    "being turned off.", 
    "And this is my usual ground node.", 
    "And let me call this node voltage with the voltage", 
    "source acting alone as ev. So ev is the partial response of", 
    "the circuit to the voltage source acting alone.", 
    "Now how do we go about solving for ev?", 
    "Notice that we have a known pattern here.", 
    "We have a voltage source connected to a pair of", 
    "resistors, R1 and R2.", 
    "And ev is simply the voltage across R2.", 
    "Now this is a known pattern.", 
    "So one thing you should keep in mind is that in circuits", 
    "and electronics, we use patterns a lot.", 
    "Whenever we see a pattern, we can directly go and write down", 
    "the what the outward response is going to look like.", 
    "What I'm going to do is throughout this course, as you", 
    "we more and more patterns, I am going to alert", 
    "you to these patterns.", 
    "So right here is a voltage divider pattern.", 
    "So for the voltage divider pattern, I can write down ev", 
    "as being some fraction of the source voltage v. But the", 
    "divider action is simply R2 divide by R2 plus R2.", 
    "So it is simply the voltage across R2, and that is given", 
    "by R2 divide by R1 plus R2.", 
    "And this is a known pattern that you will find very", 
    "helpful as you analyze circuits very quickly.", 
    "Next let's look at I acting alone.", 
    "Before we do that, what do we have so far?", 
    "Again, recall, this is the circuit we", 
    "are trying to analyze.", 
    "We are trying to get the node voltage e.", 
    "And so far we have computed the partial voltage ev due to", 
    "the voltage source acting alone.", 
    "As the next step-- again, this is still step one of the", 
    "superposition method--", 
    "let's look at the partial response of the circuit due to", 
    "the current acting alone.", 
    "To get the response for the current acting alone, I need", 
    "to build a circuit in which the voltage", 
    "source is turned off.", 
    "I'll let you think for a couple of seconds as to what", 
    "the circuit will look like before I draw it out for you.", 
    "OK, let's go ahead.", 
    "So to turn off this voltage source, all I have to do is", 
    "replace it with a short circuit like so.", 
    "So notice that I have replaced the voltage source with a", 
    "short circuit, and I've left the current source in place.", 
    "I have my ground node here.", 
    "And notice that my goal is to find the partial voltage eI", 
    "that is a result of the current source acting alone.", 
    "So notice that I have a second pattern here.", 
    "And in this case, this is a current divider pattern.", 
    "Actually, this is a even simpler pattern.", 
    "I simply have a current that is flowing", 
    "into a pair of resistors.", 
    "OK, so I have a current, I, that is flowing into a pair of", 
    "resistors, R1 and R2.", 
    "And so I can compute the voltage across the pair of", 
    "resistors very straightforwardly.", 
    "So eI is simply the resistance times the current.", 
    "And the resistance of a paralel pair of resistors is", 
    "simply R1 R2 divide by R1 plus R2 times the current I.", 
    "OK, so now I have computed both ev and eI, the two", 
    "partial voltages with each of the voltages acting alone.", 
    "And now I am ready for step two of the", 
    "superposition method.", 
    "And the step two of the superposition method simply", 
    "says that you sum the two partial voltages, ev and eI.", 
    "So my resulting voltage e is simply the sum of the two", 
    "partial voltages ev and eI.", 
    "And I have those as R2 divide by R1 plus R2 times v. And I", 
    "sum that to eI.", 
    "And eI is R1 R2 divide by R1 plus R2 times I. And", 
    "there you have it.", 
    "Not surprisingly, this expression here is identical", 
    "to the expression that you obtained by using the node", 
    "method in the previous lecture."
