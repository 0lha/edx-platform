<p> The team of instructors is Anant Agarwal, Piotr Mitros, Chris
Terman, and Gerald Sussman. Our intrepid team of TAs is

<p> The main codebase was crammed out in two months by Piotr
Mitros. Evgeny Fadeev helped integrate Askbot into the
system. Schematic entry and circuit simulation are by Chris
Terman. Jean-Michel Claus designed the applets. IT and infrastructure
are managed by Scott Bloomquist of TechSquare, Inc.

<p> The codebase was made possible by Django, JQuery, JQueryUI,
MathJAX, swfobject, askbot, django-simplewiki, pyparsing, and the
original FancyBox. Graphic design and css started from a free template
from <a href="http://www.dotemplate.com/">dotemplate.com</a>, one of
the few, genuinely free template web sites (although you have to
e-mail the owner to find that out), and was heavily modified by Piotr
Mitros, and later, thoughtbot.

<p> The system is running in the Amazon cloud, which allows us to hold up
to anticipated loads.
